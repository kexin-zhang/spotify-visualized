# Spotify Visualized - 2018

An interactive [visualization](https://www.kexinzhang.com/spotify-visualized/) of Spotify's top tracks in the USA for ~2018~ [2020](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DXaqCgtv7ZR3L?si=DBgycVgmTR2qg1zN8a5J9w)! 

Data was pulled with the [Python Spotify client](https://github.com/plamere/spotipy) -- the script and dependencies can be found in the `data/` directory. The visualization was created with [D3 v5](https://d3js.org/), specifically [D3 force directed layout](https://github.com/d3/d3-force).
